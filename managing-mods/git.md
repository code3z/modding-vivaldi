# Managing and Sharing Mods with Git

Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

Git (pronounced like get) is a tool often used by developers to share and collaborate on great programs and docs (including this guide!). It allows developers to make individual changes to the main set of files and merge changes together.

To get started, you will need an account on a git hosting platform. GitHub and GitLab are two popular options (you may want an account on both, so you can talk to people who use either one).

When you set up your git repository, give it a name like vivaldi-mods, and choose a LICENSE and README.

If you've never used git before, see the resources page for some helpful information.

Like a normal file storage service, the git repository allows you to upload a folder containing your mods either using a desktop client or a web client, and to get a raw link where people can download a mod file, as well as the ability for people to download a ZIP file.

Like a normal file storage service, the git repository can help you sync mods between different devices.

Unlike a normal file storage service, someone can fork your repository, add their own changes, and request their changes to be merged in, thus making your mod better.

All of these things make git a better way to store mods than copy-and-pasting them onto the forum post. Having everyone store their mods in a git repository would also make it easier to make a community collection of mods and/or a better way to install mods in the future.

## If using Git, should I also post mods to the forum?

You should definitely create a forum topic for each mod you make (see community/sharing). But instead of copy-and-pasting the latest version of your mod into the forum post, you can just add a link to the correct file in the git repository.
