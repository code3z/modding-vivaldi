# Using the Forum

The [modding forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) will be extremely helpful to learning how to mod and getting mods from others. You will need a [vivaldi account](https://login.vivaldi.net) to post there. Git and Github will also be good tools for working on and sharing your mods.

And don't hesitate to make your own modding repository!
