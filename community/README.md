# Using the Forum

The [modding forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications)
will be extremely helpful to learning how to mod and getting mods from others.
You will need a [vivaldi account](https://login.vivaldi.net) to post there.

Github/Gitlab will also be good tools for working on, managing, and sharing your
mods, and will allow you to comment, contribute to, and raise issues on other
community member's repositories, so you could sign up for an account there.
