# Sharing your Mods
Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

Once you've created a mod that you're proud of, the next step is to share it. Sharing will be a big help to other people. You can also get feedback and help from the community. But it may also mean you have to respond to bugs in your code and help other people use your code.


## Code headers

Putting a comment at the top of your code helps people understand it, use it, and remember where it came from. Consider using this template:
```
/**
 * <TITLE>
 * <Coding languages>
	- - -   
 * Description:        <description>
 * Filename:          <filename>
 * Platform:          <Linux/Mac/Windows/All>
 * Version:           <version>
 * Last update:        yyyy-mm-dd      
 * Author(s):          <github username, forum username, other contributors>
 * Topic:             https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/<topic>
**/
```

### Versioning Your Mods

Instead of tracking each edit to your mod as a separate version, its easier and sometimes more helpful to include the latest version of Vivaldi that it was tested in. Along with the last update time, this will let you and others keep track of the mod version.

If you do want to version your mods, it would look like this:
```
Version: 2.1 for Vivaldi 3.9.2289.3
```

If you want to keep it simple and use date/vivaldi version, it would look like this (see the header template above):
```
* Version:           Vivaldi 3.9.2289.3
* Last update:        year-month-day      
```

## Tagging your Mods

Tagging your mods helps others find them. Use the forum tagging feature to insert the following tags, in addition to any others you want:
[Mod]
[CSS] and/or [JS]
[Area] (what area of the UI does it affect?)

> Please don't make new tags on your own!
