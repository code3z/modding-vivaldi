# Sharing your Mods
Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

Once you've created a mod that you're proud of, the next step is to share it. Sharing will be a big help to other people. You can also get feedback and help from the community. But it may also mean you have to respond to bugs in your code and help other people use your code.
