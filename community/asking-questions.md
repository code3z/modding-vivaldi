# Asking Questions on the Forum

Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

The [modding forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) is also a great place to ask questions about modding. Before asking, search the forum and the internet to check if there is not already a good answer.

When asking a question, keep a few simple things in mind:
 - Use a topic title that is descriptive
 - Be polite and don't use ALL CAPS
 - If you are asking questions or trying to debug a certain piece of code, share that code
 - Share any ways you thought
 - Don't add the "mod" tag to your post - save that for when you actually publish a mod
