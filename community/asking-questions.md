# Asking Questions on the Forum

Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

The [modding forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) is also a great place to ask questions about modding. Before asking, search the forum and the internet to check if there is not already a good answer.

When asking a question, keep a few simple things in mind:
 - Use a topic title that is descriptive
 - Be polite and don't use ALL CAPS
 - If you are asking questions about a certain piece of code, share that code
 - Share any ways you thought you might fix the problem or things that didn't work
 - Don't add the "mod" tag to your post - save that for when you actually publish a mod

## Asking For mods

You can use the forum to ask someone to make a mod for you. But remember that it is a big favor: if they wanted this mod themselves, they would have almost certainly made it. So be patient and realize that you may not get an answer at all, especially if what you're asking is hard to do. If you think that what you're asking should be implemented in Vivaldi directly, make sure you have made a feature request for it in the correct section of the forum.
