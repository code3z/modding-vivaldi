# Asking Questions on the Forum
Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

The [modding forum]() is also a great place to ask questions about modding. Before asking:
 - Search the forum and the internet to make sure there is not already a good answer

When asking a question:
 - Be polite and don't use ALL CAPS
 - If you are asking questions or trying to debug a certain piece of code, share that code
