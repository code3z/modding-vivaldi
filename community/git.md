# Sharing mods with git

Author(s): code3z (@code3 on the forum)

Git is a tool often used by developers to share and collaborate on great programs and docs (including this guide!). It allows developers to make individual changes to the main set of files and merge changes together.

By using it to share your mods, you can make it easier to download a copy of all your mods, upload multiple files, put a license on all your mods, and allow others to suggest changes to make your mods better. If the Git provider has features like Issues and Projects, it can make it easier to collect bugs and plan new mods.
